-----------------------	
15-July-1999 A.Miyamoto
-----------------------	
(1) SONAME in makejsf.tmpl and Imakefile were changed to SOLIBNAME
	
**********************************************************
jsf-1-10  15-July-1999 A.Miyamoto
**********************************************************
-----------------------	
15-July-1999 A.Miyamoto
-----------------------	
(1) example/jsfjim is aded.
(2) example/guiexam1/MainMacro.C is modified to suppress QuickSimulator
    data output by switch.  To do it,
       jsf --EventDataOff  gui.C

-----------------------	
25-June-1999 A.Miyamoto
-----------------------	
(1) Installed on RH6.0 using ROOT 2.22/06.
    bin/makespec is modified to create include/JSFConfig.h, where system information are
    stored.  Now JSFConfig.h can be used both in source files and Imakefiles.
(2) Due to change in ROOT 2.22, Imakefiles are modified slightly.

      very long distance.  This bug was fixed.
  (4)  Short size variables in JSFGeneratorParticle classes are changed to
      Integer*4 size.  Integer*2 is too small to save all PID.
      JSFGeneratorParticle.h JSFSIMDST.cxx simdstutil.F 
      are changed accordingly.  This is SIMDST version is set to 2.03

   and modiifed.  Hopefully this does not cause problem in previous
   root version.
2) Create a script, bin/makespec, to save information about system configuration
   into conf/spec file.  Now g2c and f2c is swicthed automatically on linux system.
3) Put FC = g77 for LinuxArchitecture for conf/makejsf.tmpl
	
-----------------------	
9-April-1999 A.Miyamoto	
-----------------------	
1) There was a bug in putting particles to JSFGeneratorParticle class
   in PythiaGenerator class.  It was modified.

	
**********************************************************
jsf-1-7  9-April-1999 A.Miyamoto
**********************************************************
(1) Add JSFReadGenerator class to read HEPEVT format Fortran binray data.
(2) PythiaGenerator class is modified to save all intermediate particles
    in the JSFGenerator class.
(3) Modify files in example/simdst and macro/MainSimdst.C to add
    options to make simdst data while reading the generator data.
(4) Default parameters set in JSFQuickSimParam is same as 
  $LCLIBROOT/param/detect7.com

	
**********************************************************
jsf-1-6  1-April-1999 A.Miyamoto
**********************************************************
(1) Format of SIMDST data is changed.   Calorimeter hit information
    saved in array, EMH and HDH are changed as follows.
	EMH(1,i) = EMC Energy in MeV deposited by EM particle.
	EMH(2,i) = EMC Energy in MeV deposited by HD particle.
	EMH(3,i) = EMC hit cell number

	HDH(1,i) = HDC Energy in MeV deposited by EM particle.
	HDH(2,i) = HDC Energy in MeV deposited by HD particle.
	HDH(3,i) = HDC hit cell number
    EMH and HDH are both Integer*4 variable.
    Version of this format is 202.  If the version number of read-in data
    is not 202, the program is terminated.
(2) JSFCALHit.h is modified to follow change of (1)
(3) JSFQuickSim.cxx/h and JSFQuickSimParam.cxx/h are modified following 
    changes in lclib-98a-4.  In JSFQuickSim.cxx, Track parameter
    in the bank Production:CDC_VTX;Track_Parameter is saved in the class
    JSFCDCTrack, which is a combined track parameter of CDC and VTX.
    So far Production:CDC;Track_Parameter was stored.
(4) Change Imakefile in example directory to include -lpacklib in the link
    library list.  It is used to load a subroutine to invert matrix which 
    is used to create the combined track parameter of CDC and VTX.  
    All Imakefiles  to create executables including Quick Simulator 
    must include -lpacklib.
(5) macro/MainSimDST.C is modified to produce LCFULL and SIMDST branch
    in the output root tree.  Without this, root files created
    by the script, example/simdst/simdst.C, is not readin properly.
(6) JSFHelicalTrack class is expanded to include functions required 
    to Vertex hit fitting.  But this is preliminary.
	
**********************************************************
jsf-1-5  10-March-1999 A.Miyamoto
**********************************************************
(1) Add several member functions in JSFGenertorParticle class
(2) Typo in src/JSFSIMDST.h and fixed.
(3) There was a problem in JSFCDCTrack.cxx. aCC of HP-UX does not allow 
  to set address of float/int variable to pointer of Double variable.  
  It abend at that point. So program is changed so as not to use such 
  statement in case of R__ACC is defined.
(4) Add JSFBasicClasses.h to define frequently used basic classes.
(5) Add HitPostion fnction in JSFCALGeoParm class.
(6) Separate JSFQuickSim to JSFQuickSim and JSFQuickSimParam	
(7) Add example/gui1exam1 as a GUI example.
(8) For event display, Detector Parameters are obtained from the pointer in 
    JSFQuickSimParam	
(9) make example/CCDAnal is omitted from make install, since it can not compiled by
    aCC of HPUX
	
**********************************************************
jsf-1-4  16-Feburary-1999 A.Miyamoto
**********************************************************
(1) Save Ecm properly in PythiaGenerator.cxx
(2) A bug in JSFQuickSim.cxx.  fHDCal was not set.
(3) A Bug in PythiaGenerator.cxx  ctau and decay length is reversed when creating
    JSFGeneratorParticle class.
(4) Add new classes for QuickSimulator, JSFCDCTrack, JSFVTXHit, JSFCALHit, 
    JSFSIMDST.  A Library for Quick Simulator is created as libJSFQuickSIM.a,
    which includes JSFQuickSim and JSFLTKCLTrack also.
    A class, JSFQuickSimData class 
(5) remove -g option in makejsf.tmpl.
(6) in src/jsfmain.cxx, include dummy routine to call setupJSF... routines,
    otherwise Classes such as JSFSTEER are not loaded properly on Linux.
    When -g option is included there was not this kind of problem.
(7) JSFCALGeoParam class is added to JSFQuickSim.h.
(8) Instead of output detector data of the simulator into a single branch,
    LTKCLTracks/CDCTracks and VTX/EMC/HDC hits classes are written into
    separate branch.
(9) Add Float_t data argument type in JSFLCFULL::TBGET.
(10) In conf/makejsf.tmpl, remove LCDIR difinition.  Now it must be defined
     as an environment variable, LCLIBROOT.
(11) src/JSFQuickSim.h  A function GetNtrack() is renamed to GetNTrack(),
     for the compatibility with other functions, GETCDCTracks, etc.
(12) example/ZHStudy : Imakefile is changed to use LCLIBROOT variable.
     Do ln -s example/ZHStudy/jsfmain.cxx jsfmain.cxx
(13) JSFSIMDST class to output SIMDST format data or read it.
(14) In the Makefile at the top directory, add an entry, makeweb, to create
     html file.  bin/webindx script is also added.
(15) Data member and functions of JSFGeneratorParticle are defined as 
     Float_t instead of Double_t, to reduce output data size.
