   into conf/spec file.  Now g2c and f2c is swicthed automatically on linux system.

-----------------------	
9-April-1999 A.Miyamoto	
-----------------------	
1) There was a bug in putting particles to JSFGeneratorParticle class
   in PythiaGenerator class.  It was modified.

	
**********************************************************
jsf-1-7  9-April-1999 A.Miyamoto
**********************************************************
(1) Add JSFReadGenerator class to read HEPEVT format Fortran binray data.
(2) PythiaGenerator class is modified to save all intermediate particles
    in the JSFGenerator class.
(3) Modify files in example/simdst and macro/MainSimdst.C to add
    options to make simdst data while reading the generator data.
(4) Default parameters set in JSFQuickSimParam is same as 
  $LCLIBROOT/param/detect7.com

	
**********************************************************
jsf-1-6  1-April-1999 A.Miyamoto
**********************************************************
(1) Format of SIMDST data is changed.   Calorimeter hit information
    saved in array, EMH and HDH are changed as follows.
	EMH(1,i) = EMC Energy in MeV deposited by EM particle.
	EMH(2,i) = EMC Energy in MeV deposited by HD particle.
	EMH(3,i) = EMC hit cell number

	HDH(1,i) = HDC Energy in MeV deposited by EM particle.
	HDH(2,i) = HDC Energy in MeV deposited by HD particle.
	HDH(3,i) = HDC hit cell number
    EMH and HDH are both Integer*4 variable.
    Version of this format is 202.  If the version number of read-in data
    is not 202, the program is terminated.
(2) JSFCALHit.h is modified to follow change of (1)
(3) JSFQuickSim.cxx/h and JSFQuickSimParam.cxx/h are modified following 
    changes in lclib-98a-4.  In JSFQuickSim.cxx, Track parameter
    in the bank Production:CDC_VTX;Track_Parameter is saved in the class
    JSFCDCTrack, which is a combined track parameter of CDC and VTX.
    So far Production:CDC;Track_Parameter was stored.
(4) Change Imakefile in example directory to include -lpacklib in the link
    library list.  It is used to load a subroutine to invert matrix which 
    is used to create the combined track parameter of CDC and VTX.  
    All Imakefiles  to create executables including Quick Simulator 
    must include -lpacklib.
(5) macro/MainSimDST.C is modified to produce LCFULL and SIMDST branch
    in the output root tree.  Without this, root files created
    by the script, example/simdst/simdst.C, is not readin properly.
(6) JSFHelicalTrack class is expanded to include functions required 
    to Vertex hit fitting.  But this is preliminary.
	
**********************************************************
jsf-1-5  10-March-1999 A.Miyamoto
**********************************************************
(1) Add several member functions in JSFGenertorParticle class
(2) Typo in src/JSFSIMDST.h and fixed.
(3) There was a problem in JSFCDCTrack.cxx. aCC of HP-UX does not allow 
  to set address of float/int variable to pointer of Double variable.  
  It abend at that point. So program is changed so as not to use such 
  statement in case of R__ACC is defined.
(4) Add JSFBasicClasses.h to define frequently used basic classes.
(5) Add HitPostion fnction in JSFCALGeoParm class.
(6) Separate JSFQuickSim to JSFQuickSim and JSFQuickSimParam	
(7) Add example/gui1exam1 as a GUI example.
(8) For event display, Detector Parameters are obtained from the pointer in 
    JSFQuickSimParam	
(9) make example/CCDAnal is omitted from make install, since it can not compiled by
    aCC of HPUX
	
**********************************************************
jsf-1-4  16-Feburary-1999 A.Miyamoto
**********************************************************
(1) Save Ecm properly in PythiaGenerator.cxx
(2) A bug in JSFQuickSim.cxx.  fHDCal was not set.
(3) A Bug in PythiaGenerator.cxx  ctau and decay length is reversed when creating
    JSFGeneratorParticle class.
(4) Add new classes for QuickSimulator, JSFCDCTrack, JSFVTXHit, JSFCALHit, 
    JSFSIMDST.  A Library for Quick Simulator is created as libJSFQuickSIM.a,
    which includes JSFQuickSim and JSFLTKCLTrack also.
    A class, JSFQuickSimData class 
(5) remove -g option in makejsf.tmpl.
(6) in src/jsfmain.cxx, include dummy routine to call setupJSF... routines,
    otherwise Classes such as JSFSTEER are not loaded properly on Linux.
    When -g option is included there was not this kind of problem.
(7) JSFCALGeoParam class is added to JSFQuickSim.h.
(8) Instead of output detector data of the simulator into a single branch,
    LTKCLTracks/CDCTracks and VTX/EMC/HDC hits classes are written into
    separate branch.
(9) Add Float_t data argument type in JSFLCFULL::TBGET.
(10) In conf/makejsf.tmpl, remove LCDIR difinition.  Now it must be defined
     as an environment variable, LCLIBROOT.
(11) src/JSFQuickSim.h  A function GetNtrack() is renamed to GetNTrack(),
     for the compatibility with other functions, GETCDCTracks, etc.
(12) example/ZHStudy : Imakefile is changed to use LCLIBROOT variable.
     Do ln -s example/ZHStudy/jsfmain.cxx jsfmain.cxx
(13) JSFSIMDST class to output SIMDST format data or read it.
(14) In the Makefile at the top directory, add an entry, makeweb, to create
     html file.  bin/webindx script is also added.
(15) Data member and functions of JSFGeneratorParticle are defined as 
     Float_t instead of Double_t, to reduce output data size.
