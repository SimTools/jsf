How to use this program.
----------------------------

(1) Prior to use this program, use needs to prepare libraries for ZVTOP.
To do this, 
  
   $ cd ../../../zvtop
   $ make all

(2) Then, run mkdata script in this diretory.  

   $ ./mkdata

   This command creates three root files containing ntuple objects 
   for ZVTOP analysis.

(3) Then, run ctag.C script as follows.

   $ jsf ctag.C

    At the end of execution, ctag.C script displays two histograms;
    The histogram of the training history and the one to compare 
    signal and background distribution.

    Since number of variables used for c/b/s separation are not enough, 
    separation is insufficient and further improvements needs to be 
    impremented by user for physics study.
