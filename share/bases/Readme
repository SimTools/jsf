Files in this directory is C++ version of Bases/Spring developped
by Setsuya Kawabata, 2000.

[Contents of directories]:
src/             source files for bases/spring system
example/nunugam  stand alone example of bases 

[How to build library]:
 1) Make sure JSFROOT environparameter is set properly.
 2) Then, do
    $ cd src
    $ xmkmf -a
    $ make
    $ make install
  
     "make install" copies library in $(JSFROOT)/lib and create a 
     symbolic link of header files in $(JSFROOT)/include
  
[How to run example]:
  Example to calculate the cross secion of  e+e- -> nu nu~ gamma and event 
  generation is in example/nunugam.  To create executables, do
   
    $ cd example/nunugam
    $ xmkmf -a
    $ make

  To run bases example, do

    $ bases

  This program writes a result in a file, bases.data
  
  To run spring using the above result, do

    $ spring

  To run bases and spring subsequently, do

    $ basesspring

  Results of these jobs are in files, jobout.bases, jobout.spring,
  jobout.basesspring.

  Main program for them are in testint.cxx, testgen.cxx, and intgen.cxx.
  User initialization and user function are defined in nunugam.cxx.
  In this example, user integration function is called without
  argument.  In the function, user refers the integral variable
  by his own variable, not through an array X.
