(Purpose of this directory)
--------------------------

The ROOT library for Pythia6, libEGPythia6.so, required
the pythia package.  The binary library, libPythia6.so, distributed from 
ROOT web site is 6.131, which is not exactly same as the version 
included in CERN2001 package, pythia 6.152.  In addition, the pythia
package is updated independantly with ROOT/CERN.  Therefore, this directory 
is created to allow JSF users to build pythia libraries for ROOT and JSF 
based using his/her prefered pythia version.


--------------------------
(How to build pythia library)
--------------------------

On linux system, do

$ makePythia6.linux

This scripts compile and build library, libPythia6.so, which including 
the original pythia program together with root interfaces to pythia.
The created shared library, libPythia6.so, and the include file,
pythia6.inc, are then copied to the include and lib directory 
of JSF, which must be exist at ../../../ relative to this directory.

The test program of pythia, pythia_test.f, is also compiled 
and executed.  To run this test program, the environment variable,
JSFROOT, must be set properly.

Unfortunately, build on another system is not tested yet.


--------------------------
(Caution)
--------------------------

Once, libPythia6.so, is created, re-configure ROOT and compile/link
TPythia6 so as to use newly created pythia package.

When you use TPythia6, make sure not to include pythia library 
in CERNLIB or elsewhere whose version may not be same as what you have
created.  

In the JSF system, the version of pythia is controlled by the flag, 
PYTHIA_VERSION, which must be prepared in $(JSFROOT)/conf/configure.in.
It is refered by a command, $JSFROOT/bin/makespec, which is executed 
through "make install" command at the directory, $JSFROOT and 
saved in $JSFROOT/include/JSFConfig.h for use in subsequent 
compilation.  If PYTHIA_VERSION is 6, JSF uses 
$JSFROOT/lib/libPythia6.so.  If PYTHIA_VERSION is not 6, 
it uses the pythia libraries in $CERN_ROOT/lib/libjetset74.a.
