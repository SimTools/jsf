About CCDAnal directory

This directory contains source codes of CCD beam data analysis
as an example of beam test data analysis.

There are four JSF module class is defined. Their name and functions are

CCDRawData       : Read CCD raw data ans store it as root class.
CCDCorrectDark   : subtruct dark data from CCDRawData
CCDRawHist       : Make histograms of CCD raw data.
CCD2x2Cluster    : Does 2x2 clustering and results are saved as class.

There are run dependance in the unpacking process of CCDRawData and 
they are summarized in the CCDRawData3 class (3 means unpacking class for 
beam test number 3).

In addition there are data base class inherited from JSFDBS class.
There are three types of dababase information; RunIndex, Pedestal,
and DarkData.  These classes are defined in CCDDBS.h/CCDDBS.cxx.
A macro makedbs.C was used to create the data base fiel, jsfdbs.root.
The marco converts standard dark data into the root file.
Index of the data base is run number.  Any infomation in the data base
can be retrieved by specifying the run number as follows,
  run1651 = new CCDRunIndex(1651);
but currently only run1651 information is stored.


As examples of usages, following macros are prepared;
format.C     ; create formatted data, namely CCD rawdata stored in the root file.
anal.C       ; does upto 2x2 clustering from raw data file.
ranal.C      ; read formatted data and does analysis
rawph.C      ; read formatted data and make pulse height histogram after pedestal subtruction
read.C       ; just read a jsf root.file
makedbs.C    ; create the data base.
readdbs.C    ; read the data base record.
