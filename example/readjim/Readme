This is an example to read JLCSIM data by JSF.  

There are still several inconsistency in the data.
Due to error, the program will break.
Please note that this version is prepared as a test version.

To build a program,

$ setenv JLCSIMROOT [jlcsim-directory]
$ xmkmf
$ make install

To run sample program do,

$ jsf rjim.C
  
  ( this macro reads a data file, jetset_qq_fast.bnk )
