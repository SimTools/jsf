This directory contains an example to run Quick Simulator of e+e- -> ZH 
process and study the 2 jet mass resolution, when Z decays to neu+bar(neu)
and H decays to 2 jets.  MyAnalysis.cxx in this directory creates 
the mini-DST information of the process

To build the JSF application, do

$ xmkmf
$ make

To run Simulator macro in batch mode, do

$ jsf -q -b zhsim.C 

To analize the simulated result, do

$ jsf -q -b zha.C

If -b option is omitted, histograms are displayed during event analysis.
