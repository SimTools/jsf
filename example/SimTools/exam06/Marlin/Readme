Example to run Marlin.

Marlin reads a Mokka file.
GearOutput.xml should be updated to match your detector configuration.
GearOutput.xml is created by Mokka.
Output file, number of events to analize, defined in stdreco.xml 
should be modified properly to match your condition.

runMarlin.sh corresponds to ilcsoft/v01-06.
For other version, runMarlin.sh and stdreco.xml 
needs to be modified.
