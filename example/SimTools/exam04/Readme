A complex example including jet clustering, event shape analysis,
and vertexing using ZVTOP program.  

To build and run program, do as follows.

[1] $ xmkmf -a
[2] $ make

[3] $ jsf -b -q --maxevt=10000 gui.C
  --> This generates 10k events of ZH events and save event parameters
      in a file, jsf.root

[4] $ mv jsf.root anal.root
  --> rename jsf.root to anal.root

[5] $ jsf plot2.C
  --> analize information saved in a file, anal.root and calculate
      chisq, higgs mass, etc and saves them in a file, plotdata.root
      as a ntuple file.

[6] $ jsf plotdata.root
    root [0] ntuple->Draw("mh","chisq<25");
   
    This will create a figure of Higgs mass distribution,
    selected from 4-jet mode.  In this analysis, chisq is defines as
    
      chisq= ( ( Mz - 91.1)/3 )**2 + ( (Mmm - 91.1)/6 )**2

    where Mz is a invariant mass of a jet pair, and Mmm is 
    a missing mass calculated from a remaining jet pair.

    A sample figure is sample.eps.
