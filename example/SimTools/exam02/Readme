examples/JSF_QuickSim/Readme

  Simple Analysis Program.  Does same analysis as exam01, namely
  create a root file, containing the ntuple which contains
    (1) Number of generatorparticles(ngen)
    (2) Total energies of charged tracks(ech), gammas(egam), and neutral hadrons(enh)
        from generator particle information
    (3) Total observed energies(evis) and missing Pt(ptmis).
 
  To build this program and to run do,
   $ xmkmf -a
   $ make
   $ jsf -b -q --maxevt=100 gui.C
 
  where --maxevt option defines a number of events to simulate and analize.
 


This program was created from a sample program generated by buildjsf command.
