JSF is a library for studies of Joint Linear Collider Working group,
( http://acfahep.kek.jp/ ).  The home page of the JSF is prepared at
http://www-jlc.kek.jp/subg/offl/jsf/jsf.html, and releated information
may be found also at http://acfahep.kek.jp/subg/sim/index.html.

This program is based on the ROOT, which is described in http://root.cern.ch/.

We have started the project to get familiar with Object-Oriented technology 
to apply them to High Energy Physics. JSF is still developping and many 
changes and inclusion of new source codes are expected in near future.
Please remind that there may be bugs and we may change codes without backword 
compatibility for beter functionality.  

Please send any comment to Akiya.Miyamoto@kek.jp. We would be very happy to 
hear any thing from you. We welcome anyone to participate the development.
