How to install

0) Install ROOT4.00/06 or later

1) Do
	setenv CERN_ROOT <<cern directory>>
	setenv LCLIBROOT <<lclib directory>>
	setenv ROOTSYS <<root directort>>
	setenv JSFROOT <<jsf directort>>
	set path=(. $JSFROOT/bin $ROOTSYS/bin $path)
	setenv IMAKEINCLUDE "-I$JSFROOT -I$LCLIBROOT"

2) For sucesfull installation Pythia is mandatory,
 but that is not included in the standard distribution.

 Please get it from http://www.thep.lu.se/~torbjorn/Pythia.html
 or anywhere else, and save in $JSFROOT/share/phythia directory.
 File name is something like, pythia6222.f. In this case 6 is 
 a version number and 222 is a sub version number.
 Then specify these numbers in a file, conf/configure.in.
 There you have to specify 
	PYTHIA_VERSION
	PYTHIA_SUBVERSION
	PYTHIA_LIBNAME

 Make sure, LCLIB and ROOT are compiled with same version 
 number. Pythia5, Pythia6.1, and Pythia6.2 have different
 common block definition and we can not support different different
 version with same library.  Current (1-July-2004) ROOT default
 supports Pythia6.2, thus you can use a ROOT binary without compilation 
 if you use Pythia6.2
  
 To use Pythia6.1 or before, some source code modification of 
 ROOT-Pythia-JSF interface is necessary.

3) do 
	cd $JSFROOT
	make install

4) Utility macros are prepared in $JSFROOT/macro.  To use them without
   specify full pathname, copy $JSFROOT/macro/dot.rootrc to .rootrc 
   file in your home directory ( ~/.rootrc) or append it if you have
   already.

that's it.
