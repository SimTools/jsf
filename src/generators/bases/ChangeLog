  In the Bases step, histograms were accumulated both during 
the grid defining step and the accumulation step, though they were
normalized by the variable, SCALLS, which was reset to zero 
just before the accumlation step.  As a result, dsigma/dx of histograms
printed by bases_xhplot, etc were not correct.

To avoid this problem, we utilize a variable, bases_flag
and histograms are not filled during the grid defining step.
