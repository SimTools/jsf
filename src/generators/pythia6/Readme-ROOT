  Pythia version is modifed from 6222 to 6319,
  when ROOT version for JSF is updated to 4.03.04.
  Accordingly, following comments are not valid.
  They are kept here just as a history record.

Comments about the instruction written below. 
---------------------------
Information below is valid, but not up-to-date for user 
using ROOT-4.00/06, or possibly later. The binary 
package on the ROOT web site is good and ROOT package 
is not need to be recompiled, as long as Pythia6.2 
or later is used. As written in the file, HowToInstall,
(1) get file from Pythia web site and put in this directory
(2) modify conf/configure.in accordingly
then execute the standard make install

(Purpose of this directory)
--------------------------

The ROOT library for Pythia6, libEGPythia6.so, required
the pythia package.  The binary library, libPythia6.so, distributed from 
ROOT web site is 6.131, which is not exactly same as the version 
included in CERN2001 package, pythia 6.152.  In addition, the pythia
package is updated independantly with ROOT/CERN.  Therefore, this directory 
is created to allow JSF users to build pythia libraries for ROOT and JSF 
based using his/her prefered pythia version.


--------------------------
(How to build pythia library)
--------------------------

On linux system, do

$ makePythia6.linux

This scripts compile and build library, libPythia6.so, which including 
the original pythia program together with root interfaces to pythia.
The created shared library, libPythia6.so, and the include file,
pythia6.inc, are then copied to the include and lib directory 
of JSF, which must be exist at ../../../ relative to this directory.

The test program of pythia, pythia_test.f, is also compiled 
and executed.  To run this test program, the environment variable,
JSFROOT, must be set properly.

Unfortunately, build on another system is not tested yet.


--------------------------
(Caution)
--------------------------

Once, libPythia6.so, is created, re-configure ROOT and compile/link
TPythia6 so as to use newly created pythia package.

When you use TPythia6, make sure not to include pythia library 
in CERNLIB or elsewhere whose version may not be same as what you have
created.  

In the JSF system, the version of pythia is controlled by the flag, 
PYTHIA_VERSION, which must be prepared in $(JSFROOT)/conf/configure.in.
It is refered by a command, $JSFROOT/bin/makespec, which is executed 
through "make install" command at the directory, $JSFROOT and 
saved in $JSFROOT/include/JSFConfig.h for use in subsequent 
compilation.  If PYTHIA_VERSION is 6, JSF uses 
$JSFROOT/lib/libPythia6.so.  If PYTHIA_VERSION is not 6, 
it uses the pythia libraries in $CERN_ROOT/lib/libjetset74.a.
