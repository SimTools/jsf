  At the time of this writting, Pythia library is obtained 
  from root web site, http://root.cern.ch/, which posts
  the latest version of pythia, 6.319.  The file on this 
  directory was created from those on ROOT's web site.

  ROOT-to-Pythia interface was changed, some time between 
  version 4.00.08 to 4.03.04.  Namely, pythia6_common_address.c
  was introduced instead of pythia6_common_block_address.F.
  The version on the root's web site does not contain 
  pythia6_common_block_address.F any more, but we included 
  in libPythia6.so library for compatibility of users using 
  old version of Root. 



----------------------------------------
Note to JSF users
----------------------------------------

This directory contains
 (1) Source code of Pythia
 (2) Root-Pythia interface
 (3) Pythia test program and Makefiles, etc.

Source code of Pythia was obtainied from 
http://www.thep.lu.se/~torbjorn/Pythia.html.
There was a bug in the initialization of MDME(4178,1) of PYDAT3 
common.  According to the suggestion by T.Sjosstrand, 
pythia6202.f is modified and MDME(4178,1) is set to -1
instead of the original value of 0.

Source code of Root-Pythia interface was obtained from 
http://root.cern.ch/

When ROOT library, libEGPythia6.so is created, please make sure to 
use libPythia6.so library created here, Otherwise, imcompatibility 
of Pythia library may happen.

This directory was prepared to use the latest version of Pythia program
in JSF/ROOT environment.
