This is a sample program to create an input file for JIM by JSF.
Pythia Generator is used to create particle's four momentum.
To run this program, use jsfjim command.  The jsf command is not
adequate as it does not include JIM objects and jsfrjim command is 
not adequate as it does not include PYTHIA objects.

An example to run this program is

jsfjim -b -q --maxevt=100 --OutputFile=jiminput.bnk gui.C

This will run 100 events of Pythia events.
Generated data is saved in a file, jiminput.bnk, which is 
ZBS format and can be used for JIM simulator.
