//*  Dummy UserAnalysis Script to be used with gui.C 
//*  Functions in this scripts are called by GUIMainMacro.C  
//*  
//*  In this script, global functions, UserInitialize() nad UserAnalysis()
//*  Must be defined.  UserInitialize() is called at job initialization 
//*  to initialize histograms, etc.  It is also called when reset historgam
//*  menu is selected from JSF Control Panel.  UserAnalysis() is called 
//*  during the event loop after executing Process functions of JSF modules
//*  and display event daia but before display histogram.  See GetEvent()
//*  function in GUIMainMacro.C, where UserAnalysis() is called.
//*
//*  UserSetOptions() and UserTerminate() may be defined in this file.
//*  UserSetOptions() are called before declaration of JSF modules.
//*  It can be used to set parameters optional for user analsis.
//*  UserTerminate() is called during the JSF termination process.
//*
//*  When runmode=4, UserModuleDefine() must be defined in this file.
//*  It is used to define JSF modules specific to user analysis.
